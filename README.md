This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model for a Ball Mill classification system to estimate the proportion of material retained in three sieve ranges:
>35 (Coarse),
35 to 200 (Intermediate),
<200 (Fine).

Using historical process dataâ€”including feed rates, equipment currents, temperatures, and pressure readingsâ€”we apply data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling techniques to build a high-accuracy model using Random Forest Regressor.
The cleaned and structured data enables not only accurate predictions but also deeper insight into feature importance and interdependencies among process variables.
This solution is designed for live deployment in industrial settings, with potential integration into real-time SCADA or DCS systems for continuous process optimization and quality control.
